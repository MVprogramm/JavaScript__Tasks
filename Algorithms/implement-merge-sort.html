			Implement Merge Sort
			
			Another common intermediate sorting algorithm is merge sort.
			Like quick sort, merge sort also uses a divide-and-conquer,
			recursive methodology to sort an array. It takes advantage of
			the fact that it is relatively easy to sort two arrays as long
			as each is sorted in the first place. But we'll start with only
			one array as input, so how do we get to two sorted arrays from
			that? Well, we can recursively divide the original input in two
			until we reach the base case of an array with one item. A
			single-item array is naturally sorted, so then we can start
			combining. This combination will unwind the recursive calls that
			split the original array, eventually producing a final sorted
			array of all the elements. The steps of merge sort, then, are:

			1) Recursively split the input array in half until a sub-array
			   with only one element is produced.

			2) Merge each sorted sub-array together to produce the final
			   sorted array.

			Merge sort is an efficient sorting method, with time complexity
			of O(nlog(n)). This algorithm is popular because it is effective
			and relatively easy to implement.

			As an aside, this will be the last sorting algorithm we cover here.
			However, later in the section on tree data structures we will
			describe heap sort, another efficient sorting method that requires
			a binary heap in its implementation.

			Instructions: Write a function mergeSort which takes an array of
			integers as input and returns an array of these integers in sorted
			order from least to greatest. A good way to implement this is to
			write one function, for instance merge, which is responsible for
			merging two sorted arrays, and another function, for instance
			mergeSort, which is responsible for the recursion that produces
			single-item arrays to feed into merge. Good luck!
