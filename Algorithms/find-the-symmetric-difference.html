	Find the Symmetric Difference

	The mathematical term symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of two sets is the set of
	elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both. For example, for
	sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, A △ B = {1, 4}.

	Symmetric difference is a binary operation, which means it operates on only two
	elements. So to evaluate an expression involving symmetric differences among
	three elements (A △ B △ C), you must complete one operation at a time. Thus,
	for sets A and B above, and 
	C = {2, 3}, A △ B △ C = (A △ B) △ C = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

	Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their
	symmetric difference. The returned array must contain only unique values
	(no duplicates)
