			Implement Insertion Sort
			
			The next sorting method we'll look at is insertion sort. This
			method works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of
			the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element.
			Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backwards into
			the sorted array until it is in sorted position. It continues
			iterating through the list and swapping new items backwards
			into the sorted portion until it reaches the end. This algorithm
			has quadratic time complexity in the average and worst cases.

			Instructions: Write a function insertionSort which takes an array
			of integers as input and returns an array of these integers in
			sorted order from least to greatest.
